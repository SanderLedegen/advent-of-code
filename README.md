# Advent of Code

## What?

An uncomplete collection of solutions for the challenges of
[AoC](http://adventofcode.com) throughout the years. Starting from the first of
December all the way to Christmas, every day a challenge is available at Advent
of Code.

## Why?

Just because it's fun to do and to escape the often boring enterprise code I
normally have to write ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

## How?

As my solutions are written in JavaScript, you can run them by using Node.js. Or
Bun. Or Deno. Or whatever.
